# Authentication

This code will serve as our starting point for exploring some of the client-side aspects of authentication.  Since we'll also need to touch on a few server-side things, this a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).  As always, before you run this app for the first time, make sure to run `npm install` to install needed dependencies.  Then, you can run the development server by running
```
npm run dev
```
After doing this, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.   The app is set up so that the page will reload if you make edits to the code.
